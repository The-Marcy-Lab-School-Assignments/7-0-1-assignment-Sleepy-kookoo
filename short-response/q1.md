# Question

What are the two arguments that `useEffect` accepts? 

# Answer

Two arguments that 'useEffect' accepts are: 
- Callback Function
    - an async function that does the fetch and then invoke it immediately.
- Dependency Array 
  - execute after EVERY re-render : 
  - only execute the effect once : []
  - re-run the effect whenever the array changes between renders : [valueA, valueB]
