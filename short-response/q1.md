# Question

What are the two arguments that `useEffect` accepts? 

# Answer

Two arguments that 'useEffect' accepts are: 
- Callback Function
    - an async function that does the fetch and then invoke it immediately.
- Dependency Array 
  - execute after EVERY re-render : 
  - only execute the effect once : []
  - re-run the effect whenever the array changes between renders : [valueA, valueB]

Great job on giving examples of dependency arrays! However, your definition of the callback function is incorrect. "an async function that does the fetch and then invoke it immediately." applies for fetching asynchronously inside of a use effect, however, use effects can be used for more than just that. Give a more general definition of the function.
