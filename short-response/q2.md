# Question

Consider the React component below. Explain the three ways that we can provide a dependency array to trigger the `useEffect` callback to run. For each, provide an example of the dependency array to help explain your answer.

```js
const MyComponent = ({ someProp }) => {
  const [someState, setSomeState] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('hello world');
  }, '???');

  return (
    <div>
      <!-- Some More JSX -->
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Answer

The three ways we can provide a dependency array to trigger the 'useEffect' is :
1. 
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('hello world');
  });
    - will run after every render cycle.
    - can be useful for effects that need to run repeatedly 
    - but could cause potential performance issues or infinite loops
2. 
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('hello world');
  }, []);
    - will run only once after initial render

3. 
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('hello world');
  }, []);
    - will run after the component mounts and then again whenever someProp or someState changes.
